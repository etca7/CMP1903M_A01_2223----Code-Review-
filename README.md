OOP Code Review Assessment 1

As you can see from my comments, I tested my functions directly through the program class. Which I hope checks the "testing class" point.

Also static methods didn't work for me, but the program still runs as expected so if you think they are fine as they are or you want me to change them I would appreciate some ideas.
